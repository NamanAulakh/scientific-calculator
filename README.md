A starter kit to quickly start developing a react-native app which was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

For now, it includes following:
* `eslint`
* `babel`
* `redux`
* `redux-thunk`
* `expo`
* `react-navigation`
* `lodash`
* `husky`
* `remote-redux-devtools`
